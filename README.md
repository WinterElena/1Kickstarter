# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project and Purpose
### Purpose We’re utilizing existing crowdfunding data to help Louise make an informed decision on whether or not she wants to launch her own campaign. More accurately, when she might want to launch it and where, based on the data we analyze and deliver to her in accordance with the parameters of her budget and what we understand she wants to portray with ‘Fever’. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some of the challenges I encountered were becoming familiar and utilizing formulas I had not been exposed to prior to this class.  Utilizing VLOOKUP and COUNTIFS effectively required me to try and try again on many of the items; it was good exposure to what I keep hearing from the teaching staff that much of what we will be doing will be learning from trial and error.  I also learned how vital it is to pay attention to which column your data is!  Accidentally typing in D where you meant E will lead to potential confusion or disastrously incorrect data you might present to a client! DETAIL MATTERS!

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?  One conclusion that can be drawn is that plays with a launch date of late spring/ early Summer tend to be most successful in reaching their goal.  Steady drop in successful numbers over the summer months, while failed numbers say steadily high during those months.  I would advise her to avoid July/Aug as launch dates.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?  Looking at the Outcomes based on Goals data, you can see that plays with a goal less than $4999 are approximately 75% successful.  Whereas, if the goal increases to between $5000 to $24999 the percentage of possibility of success drops to ~ 50%.
- What are some limitations of this dataset? One limitation might be that creative items like plays, musicals, films, etc. might be interpreted differently and finding one category to file them into for this data analytic project might be a challenge.  Or defining the rules of would one item be categorized into two categories? This adds another complication and potential limitation to the data.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?  We could use a 100% stacked bar chart for the data set that shows number of successful outcomes vs. the number of failed outcomes.  I like the way the visual shows the viewer how the whole bar is divided between the 2 datasets and gives a quick glimpse of which is doing better in each dollar amount category.
We could also use a pie chart if we wanted to look at a much smaller set of data, say ‘Number of Successful Outcomes greater than $30000’, it would show that ‘greater than $50000’ accounts for most of the pie and the other numbers barely make up a fraction of it and we could delve into why that is.
